At my REU, I worked with Dr. Diana Dragomir on a project examining the compositional links between rocky exoplanets and the solar-type host stars they orbit.
'CMF Calculations' contains the equations I used to calculate the planetary and stellar core mass fraction, or the amount of iron to silicates in the planet or star.
'CMF Graphs' was used to graph the relationships between planetary and stellar core mass fraction.
